>WPF AutoComplete TextBox is an original work from [Bhardwaj Deepak](http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/801004/WPF-AutoComplete-TextBox)

This control originally features:

* Load suggestions on-demand
* Supports MVVM
* Asynchronously load suggestions
* Watermark
* Icon
* DataTemplate for suggestions
* DataTemplateSelector for suggestions

### Changes/improvements

1. I've included two more properties for making things easier:
  * MaxLength
  * CharacterCasing
2. Also, fixed up the focus control.
3. Removed VB.NET stuff from original solution.
4. Added a new demo showcasing the new capabilities
5. Added a custom style in the new demo, turning on validation messages  
6. Added property MaxPopupHeight. Setting this property, will limit the popup height to the size you wish.
7. Much more from collaborators!

### UPDATED DEMO !!!

A WPF application using the [Material Design in XAML Toolkit](http://materialdesigninxaml.net/) and MVVM.  See it in action!
